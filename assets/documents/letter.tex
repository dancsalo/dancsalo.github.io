To the Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Senior Machine Learning Engineer role for Support Products at Airbnb. A single positive customer experience can make a lifelong impression; I believe that generative machine learning can scale that kind of interaction to the entire Airbnb customer base, and I want to help build that future.

I have benefited personally from Airbnb's customer support. On the second night of our most recent Manhattan trip, I found bedbug bites on my back. Airbnb was responsive and understanding; we were awarded a full refund in a couple hours and were recommended other locations at which to finish our vacation. That experience solidified my respect for your company.

Here are three relevant sets of experiences that I would bring to this role: \\

\begin{outline}
   \1 As a Proofpoint tech lead, I have finetuned and deployed BERT models and LLMs using PyTorch, Huggingface, Docker, Kubernetes, and vLLM into our products at scale. My two years as an ML PhD student have enabled me to digest the ever-evolving NLP literature and apply SOTA techniques. \\
   \1 I have developed, deployed, and maintained reproducible ML models using a variety of classical techniques through Proofpoint's ML Platform that I manage and co-designed. The Platform leverages tools such as MLflow, Metaflow, DVC, and the AWS stack (Sagemaker, Glue, Athena, etc). \\
   \1 I have professional experience in applying machine learning to handling customer support requests. As a Senior Data Scientist at Proofpoint, I worked with large finserv companies to classify their inbound social media messages. I trained and maintained multiple NLP models to categorize spam, general complaints, and financial complaints.
\end{outline}

Thank you for taking the time to review my application. I welcome the opportunity to speak with you about my potential fit for this role. 

Best,
\newline
Dan Salo
