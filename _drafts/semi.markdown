title:  "Deep Generative Models for Generalization"
excerpt: "From VAEs to GANs, deep generative model research has taken off at a rapid pace in the past 3 years. How can we leverage these models to increase our ability to generalize from training data to test data in a classification task?"

#### Classification

The task of classification involves assigning every sample in a dataset to a specific category or multiple categories. In a binary classification task, each sample can belong to only one of two categories; examples include classifying emails as spam or not spam, classifying a breast tumor as benign or cancerous from a mammogram, and classifying a football team able to cover its spread or not cover it. We will consider only binary classification tasks moving forward as this will simplify our further discussions, but note that generative models can be applied to other types of classification tasks as well (e.g. multi-class, multi-label). Our case example will be digit classification
