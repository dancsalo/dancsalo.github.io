I am **Dan Salo**: follower of [Jesus](https://www.esv.org/John+4/), husband to the lovely [Amy](http://studentudurham.org/team), and dedicated member of the [Summit Church](http://www.summitrdu.com/) in [Durham, North Carolina](https://www.durham-nc.com/media/accolades/). I also like mathematics and programming.

I currently work at <a href="https://automatedinsights.com/">Automated Insights</a> as a Data Scientist where I am implementing and adapting state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning and machine learning to improve the generation of personalized content from data in the Wordsmith web app.

## Projects

### Image Processing

<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td><img src="/assets/about/bag_real.png" width="300"/></td>
    <td>The <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1506.01497.pdf">Faster R-CNN</a> framework is the current state-of-the-art in object detection. I implemented an adaptation for the <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/">TSA</a> while a graduate student in the laboratory of <a href="http://people.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin/">Larry
    Carin</a> at Duke University to detect sharp objects and handguns in X-ray images of carry-on luggage.</td>

### Biomedical Devices

    <td><img src="/assets/about/qdri_leds.png" width="300"/></td>
    <td>The <a href="http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127525">Quantitative Diffuse Reflectance Imaging System</a> provides Breast Cancer surgeons with intraoperative feedback about excised tumor margins. I designed, constructed, verified, and validated a novel and scalable LED light source for the system while a graduate student in the laboratory of <a href="https://nimmi.bme.duke.edu/">Nimmi Ramanujam</a> at Duke University.</td>

  <tr class="table-above">

    <td>The <a href="http://aac-rerc.psu.edu/wordpressmu/RESNA-SDC/2014/06/01/the-edemaband-north-carolina-state-university/">EdemaBand</a> empowers patients with congestive heart failure to manage their condition from home. Our Senior Design team at NC State University built, tested, and presented a prototype of the device that won first place at the <a href="http://www.ncbiotech.org/content/8th-annual-biomedical-engineering-symposium">8th Annual Biomedical Engineering Symposium</a>.</td>

    <td>The <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25104414">Extended Near Infrared</a> range can illuminate diagnostic features deep in human tissue without the cost or the danger of radioactive tracers. As an <a href="http://amgenscholars.com/university/washington-university-in-st.-louis">Amgen Scholar at Washington University in St. Louis</a> under the direction of <a href="https://www.mir.wustl.edu/research/research-laboratories/optical-radiology-laboratory-orl/research-groups/berezin-group">Mikhail Berezin</a>, I explored how these wavelengths interacted with human tissues and phantoms at different depths.
