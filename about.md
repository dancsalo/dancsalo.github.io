I am **Dan Salo**: follower of [Jesus](https://www.esv.org/John+4/), husband to the lovely [Amy](http://studentudurham.org/team), and dedicated member of the [Summit Church](http://www.summitrdu.com/) in [Durham, North Carolina](https://www.durham-nc.com/media/accolades/). I also like mathematics and programming.

I currently work at <a href="https://automatedinsights.com/">Automated Insights</a> as a Data Scientist where I am implementing and adapting state-of-the-art techniques in deep learning and machine learning to improve the generation of personalized content from data in the Wordsmith web app.

I implemented an adaptation for the <a href="https://www.tsa.gov/">TSA</a> while a graduate student in the laboratory of <a href="http://people.ee.duke.edu/~lcarin/">Larry
    Carin</a> at Duke University to detect sharp objects and handguns in X-ray images of carry-on luggage.</div>
